Sudoku Solver

User inputs one row at a time. Code will check if user has inputed 9 characters, if not it will make user enter same row again. Any non integer character will be turned into a empty space. If there are same integers in the same row, column, or 3x3 box, all the same integers other than the first will turn into a 0 (empty space).
